# Intermediate C++: Functors

Functors are objects that act like functions by overloading the () operator.
They're really cool, because they can be passed around as objects, and called as functions.

# Setup

You will need to have CMake installed on your computer, and properly added to your path.
In order to setup, run the following in a shell, then open the project in your preferred editor.
Windows setup has been configured for use with Visual Studio.

Windows:
```
cd path/to/folder
setup.cmd
```
Linux:
```
cd path/to/folder
./setup
```
